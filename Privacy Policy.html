          <p>Sun Sports is located at:</p>
          <p>Sun Sports922135291416</p>
          <p>
            It is Sun Sports’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any
            information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy
            Policy applies to
            <a href="home.html">https://www.Liberty Sports.pk</a> (hereinafter,
            “us”, “we”, or “https://www.sunsports.pk”). We respect your privacy
            and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information
            you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy
            policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain what information may be
            collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under
            what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties.
            This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through
            the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from
            other sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted
            on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing
            your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting
            our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and

          </p>
          <h1>Website Visitors</h1>
          <p>
            Like most website operators, Sun Sports collects
            non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
            and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
            language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
            visitor request. Sun Sports’s purpose in collecting non-personally
            identifying information is to better understand how Sun Sports’s
            visitors use its website. From time to time, Sun Sports may release
            non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
            publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sun Sports also collects potentially personally-identifying
            information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in
            users and for users leaving comments on https://www.sunsports.pk
            blog posts. Sun Sports only discloses logged in user and commenter
            IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
            personally-identifying information as described below.
          </p>
          <h1>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h1>
          <p>
            Certain visitors to Sun Sports’s websites choose to interact with
            Sun Sports in ways that require Sun Sports to gather
            personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
            information that Sun Sports gathers depends on the nature of the
            interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
            https://www.sunsports.pk to provide a username and email address.
          </p>
          <h1>Security</h1>
          <p>
            The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but
            remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method
            of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use
            commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information,
            we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
          </p>
          <h1>Advertisements</h1>
          <p>
            Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by
            advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the
            ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an
            online advertisement to compile information about you or others who
            use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among
            other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will
            be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of
            cookies by Sun Sports and does not cover the use of cookies by any
            advertisers.
          </p>
          <h1>Links To External Sites</h1>
          <p>
            Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not
            operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be
            directed to that third party’s site. We strongly advise you to
            review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you
            visit.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the
            content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites,
            products or services.
          </p>
          <h1>Https://www.sunsports.pk uses Google AdWords for remarketing</h1>
          <p>
            Https://www.sunsports.pk uses the remarketing services to advertise
            on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to
            our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who
            haven’t completed a task on our site, for example using the contact
            form to make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an
            advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the
            Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use
            cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits. Of course, any
            data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy
            policy and Google’s privacy policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the
            Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you can opt out of
            interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or
            permanently using a browser plugin.
          </p>
          <h1>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h1>
          <p>
            Sun Sports discloses potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
            contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
            information in order to process it on Sun Sports’s behalf or to
            provide services available at Sun Sports’s website, and (ii) that
            have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,
            contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of
            your home country; by using Sun Sports’s website, you consent to the
            transfer of such information to them. Sun Sports will not rent or
            sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
            information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and
            affiliated organizations, as described above, Sun Sports discloses
            potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
            information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other
            governmental request, or when Sun Sports believes in good faith that
            disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights
            of Sun Sports, third parties or the public at large.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a registered user of https://www.sunsports.pk and have
            supplied your email address, Sun Sports may occasionally send you an
            email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just
            keep you up to date with what’s going on with Sun Sports and our
            products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of
            information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.
            If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one
            of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in
            order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us
            support other users. Sun Sports takes all measures reasonably
            necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
            alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information.
          </p>

          <h1>Cookies</h1>
          <p>
            To enrich and perfect your online experience, Sun Sports uses

          </p>
          <p>

            Sports visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their
            computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using
            Sun Sports’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of
            Sun Sports’s websites may not function properly without the aid of
            cookies.

          <h1>E-commerce</h1>
          <p>
            Those who engage in transactions with Sun Sports – by purchasing Sun

            information, including as necessary the personal and financial
            information required to process those transactions. In each case,
            Sun Sports collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
            appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with
            Sun Sports. Sun Sports does not disclose personally-identifying
            information other than as described below. And visitors can always
            refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat
            that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
            activities.
          </p>
          <h1>Business Transfers</h1>
          <p>
            If Sun Sports, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or
            in the unlikely event that Sun Sports goes out of business or enters
            bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is
            transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such
            transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Sun Sports may
            continue to use your personal information as set forth in this
            policy.
          </p>

            its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Sun Sports’s sole
            discretion. Sun Sports encourages visitors to frequently check this
            page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of
            this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute
